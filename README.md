# GenerateJokes
Web application that generates jokes using the JokeAPI

Project is a dynamic web application that generates jokes using the JokeAPI and Axios. Axios is used to fetch jokes from the API, making asynchronous HTTP requests to retrieve two-part jokes (setup and punchline). The frontend consists of an interactive card that flips upon touch or click, revealing the joke in two parts. The backend is powered by Express.js to handle the requests and serve the content. HTML and CSS are used to style the page, with a sleek black background and smooth animations for the card flip, creating an engaging user experience.
